**Live Site / Resources:** [https://tomhuynhsg.github.io/rmit-ios-bootcamp-app-in-a-day/](https://tomhuynhsg.github.io/rmit-ios-bootcamp-app-in-a-day/)

This repository contains materials for the **"App in a Day: Designing iOS applications with SwiftUI"** workshop, held on Thursday as part of the RMIT Future Tech Camp 2025 at the Saigon South campus.

## Workshop Overview

Participants utilise Appleâ€™s Swift Playgrounds to brainstorm, prototype, and build a working iOS app. The workshop focuses on discovering UI design principles, working with sensors, and understanding App Store best practices, all guided by RMIT lecturers.

This one-day intensive session is designed to give students a hands-on experience in iOS development, from concept to a functional application.
